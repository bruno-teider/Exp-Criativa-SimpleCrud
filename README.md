This is a simple CRUD project for a college subject.

To run the backend you will need the databse running, then you go to the folder and run:

npm install

after that you can run:

npm start

Now that we have our backend running, you can open a new terminal and go to the frontend folder, there you can run:

npm install

and after that:

npm run dev

Thats how we are going to run our frontend. It will open on: http://localhost:5173
